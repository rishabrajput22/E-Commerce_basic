        <h4>FRESHNEX INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED E-WASTE RECYCLING POLICY</h4>
        <p>The Information and Communication revolution has brought enormous changes in the way we organize our lives, our economies, industries and institutions. These spectacular developments in modern times have undoubtedly enhanced the quality of our lives, but at the same time, have led to manifold problems including the problem of massive amount of hazardous waste and other waste generated from electric products. Such waste poses a serious threat to human health and environment. The issue of proper management of such hazardous E-Waste is therefore critical to the protection of livelihood, health and environment.</p>
        <p>To deal with this ever-rising problem of E-Waste, the government of India, through its Ministry of Environment and forest, formulated the E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2016.</p>

        <H4>FRESHNEX INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED STANDS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE E-WASTE UNDER E-WASTE RULES.</H4>
        <H6>The Basel Convention defines wastes as-</H6>
        <P>“Substances or objects, which are disposed off or are intended to be disposed off, or are required to be disposed off by the provisions of national laws”.</P>
        <H6>E waste has been defined as-</H6>
        <p>“Waste electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part or rejects from their manufacturing and repair process, which are intended to be discarded.”</p>
        <p>Whereas, Electrical and electronic equipment has been defined as:-</p>
        <p>"Equipment which is dependent on electrical currents or electro-magnetic fields to fully functional".</p>
        <p>Like hazardous waste, the problem of e-waste has become an immediate and long-term concern as its unregulated accumulation and recycling can lead to major environmental problems endangering human health. This calls for an urgent need for E-Waste Management so as to preserve the ecological balance and reduce landfills. Recycling end-of-life products is vital if we are to save resources and minimize waste. In this regard, we at FRESHNEX India private limited have tied up with Reteck Envirotech Pvt. Ltd, one of the world’s largest authorized E-Waste recycler, for facilitating our Organization and our customers to enable them to dispose E-Waste products after its end-of-life.</p>
